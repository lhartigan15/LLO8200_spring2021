## Welcome to Data Science (LLO8200), Spring 2021

This is a supplementary page for Professor Hartigan's section of LLO 8200 Introduction to Data Science. Make sure you bookmark and check this page frequently for the most up-to-date files to use for both async and assignments. Over the course of the term code may be optimized or corrected, so please alert me if youâ€™re going to be working ahead. (_If you do work ahead, you will be responsible for updating your work if the assignments are updated._) You should have R, RStudio, and Tidyverse installed prior to the first day of class. Instructions for installing can be found [here](./Download_or_UpdateR.docx).

We are always trying to improve the course and also leave space for learning that's most applicable to your specific class. To that end, the syllabus will be updated accordingly, as we go. The most up to date syllabus can be found here: [LLO8200 - Spring 2021 Syllabus (updated 2/22/21 7:00pm)](./Hartigan_LLO8200_syllabus_throughMar1.pdf). 

### Async/Sync RStudio (.Rmd) Files
These are the RStudio files and datasets that you will use in tandem with the async videos each week, listed by class week and LMS Module number.
1. Week 1 - [LMS Mod1 - Introduction Rmd File](./01_Intro.Rmd), [College dataset](./college.Rdata)
2. Week 2 - [LMS Mod2 - Conditional Means Rmd File](./02_conditional_means.Rmd), [Student Debt dataset](./sc_debt.Rdata), Videos: First, watch 2.1 in the LMS; then, watch "conditional means part 1" (posted to course wall) and then "conditional means part 2" (posted to course wall). These videos will direct you when to watch LMS sections 2.7 and 2.8. (Note: The two conditional means videos replace sections 2.2-2.6 and 2.9 in the LMS)
    * Additional helpful code for working with continuous data: [Creating Ntiles](./02_Creating_Ntiles.Rmd)
3. Weeks 3 & 4 - [LMS Mod3 - Plotting Conditional Means Rmd File](./03_DescriptivePlots.Rmd), [Attrition dataset](./attrition.Rdata)
4. Week 5 - [LMS Mod4 - Reading in Flat (and other) Data](./04_flatdata.Rmd)
5. Week 6 - [LMS Mod5 - Using Regression for Prediction](./05_regression.Rmd), [ELS training dataset](./els_train.Rdata), [ELS testing dataset](./els_test.Rdata)
6. Week 7 - [LMS Mod6 - Scatterplots](./06_scatterplots.Rmd), [ELS dataset - full](./els.Rdata)

### Known Corrections to Async Questions
* Week 1 - UNC Chapel Hill admit rate = 0.34

### Assignments
Each assignment (problem set) is worth 100 points. The problem sets should be uploaded to the LMS before live session on the given due date. All assignment submissions should include two files:
1. Your .Rmd code file.
2. Your "knit" assignment file. The knit file can be an html, word, or pdf document (please choose one and do not submit it in multiple formats). 

There may be a penalty for submissions not meeting these requirements.

### Additional Resources
There are a multitude of resources re. RStudio and RMarkdown on the web. Here is where I'll save some of my favorites. 
* [R Markdown Reference Guide](./rmarkdown-reference.pdf)
* [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](./rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)
* [R Color Palette Cheat Sheet](./colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf)
* [GGplot Cheat Sheet](./ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)

### Rmd Files with In-Class Annotations and Code for Async "Quick Exercises"
